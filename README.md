Leveraging OpenCV for face and eye detection, this system cleans and enhances facial image data using wavelet transforms. 
It then integrates and optimizes Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests for robust face recognition. 
Finally, the most effective model is deployed through a user-friendly web interface built with Python Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, enabling seamless interaction and result visualization.
